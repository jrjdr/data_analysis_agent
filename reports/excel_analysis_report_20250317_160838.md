## 7. Conclusion

The analysis reveals a telecommunications service with relatively balanced complaint distribution across regions and service types. While the overall resolution time (7.15 days) is consistent across most dimensions, there are opportunities to improve customer satisfaction (currently at 3.02/5) through targeted improvements in network quality, particularly addressing Call Drop issues.

The most significant areas for improvement are the resolution time for Critical and High priority issues and the overall customer experience for Fixed Line, Mobile, and TV services. Additionally, the Central region requires special attention as it shows lower satisfaction scores despite having similar resolution times to other regions.

By addressing these key areas, the company can enhance customer satisfaction while maintaining or improving resolution efficiency.
